## Closure

## Formal definition 

### A closure is a function that has access to its own scope and the scope of its parent functions. This allows it to "remember" and use variables from its outer scope, even when called outside of that scope.

## Real Life Example
### A closure in JavaScript is like a person carrying a backpack. The backpack contains everything that person needs for their journey, including tools and supplies. Similarly, a closure "carries" with it all the variables and functions it needs, even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows the inner function to access and use those variables and functions whenever it's called, creating a self-contained unit of functionality.

## Syntax
