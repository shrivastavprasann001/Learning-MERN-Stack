## Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on a server. It enables developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript, offering features like event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O operations for high-performance and scalable web applications.

### Node.js has completely changed the game for me. I can build APIs, create real-time applications, and so much more. And the best part? There's a huge community around it and tons of libraries to explore.
