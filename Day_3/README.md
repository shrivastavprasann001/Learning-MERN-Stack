## Definition

### In JavaScript, "this" refers to the current object or context in which the code is being executed.

## In simple term
### Imagine you're in a classroom with several students. Each student has a name, age, and other attributes. When a student raises their hand to ask a question, they might say, "I have a question." In this scenario, "I" is similar to "this" in JavaScript. It refers to the current person (student) who is speaking or performing an action.
